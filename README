Experimental project to build desktop application in Ruby via JRuby.

Combines a SWING Java desktop, designed with netbeans gui builder, but almost exclusively implemented in Ruby code.

ADAM concept is Asset Definition and Manipulation, enabling user to define database assetsi via XSD, XML, Excel, CSV etc,
and then manage the transformation, import or export of such assets from populated databases.

Use cases include migration of data between databases, or between databases and applications, export/import of data requiring
 complex transformations as part of the process, managment of complex test fixtures requiring a high level of coupling between assets.
