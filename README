Experimental project to build desktop application in Ruby via JRuby.

Combines a SWING Java desktop, designed with netbeans gui builder, but almost exclusively implemented in Ruby code.

ADAM concept is Asset Definition and Manipulation, enabling user to define database assets via XSD, XML, Excel, CSV etc,
and then manage the transformation, import or export of such assets from populated databases.

Use cases include migration of data between databases, or between databases and applications, export/import of data requiring
 complex transformations as part of the process, management of complex test fixtures requiring a high level of coupling between assets.

### Development

The main application Swing Window is in src/AdamMDIApplication.java

Double click to edit in the Netbeans Swing GUI Editor

Any GUI code that could not be written in JRuby is in lib/autotelik/autotelik/swing

### Gems and loading

https://github.com/monkeybars/monkeybars-core/wiki/Use-ruby-gems-in-your-application

gems are unpacked into lib/ruby e.g download builder gem save to lib/ruby

    cd lib/ruby

    jruby -S gem unpack builder.1.2.3

    # Now rename the builder directory to remove any version info.
    mv builder.1.2.3 builder

    
The main.rb file manages app init with manifest.rb setting load paths

### Installation Details

### TODO/IDEAS

Investigate Bundler to manage loading gems internally
